## Quick summary

This is a Python script for a simple Snake game built using Pygame library. Pygame framework is used in this program. The game is just like the original: a snake trying to eat an apple. You are the snake; move using the arrow keys, and avoid eating your own tail.


## Version:

   1.0.0 


## How to run tests

   To test if Pygame is installed correctly, create a new Python file and add the ```main.py``` code.
   
   Save the file and run it. If Pygame is installed correctly, a window should appear with snake in it. Pressing the close button should exit the window and terminate the program.

## Deployment instructions

  Install Python on your system. You can download Python from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow the installation instructions.
  
  Once you have installed Python, you can install Pygame using pip, which is the package installer for Python. 
  
  Open the terminal or command prompt and type the following command: 
  
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
  
  And it will download and install the latest version of Pygame on your system.
	
## Basic Instructions

  Use the arrow keys to move: the left arrow key to move left, the right arrow key to move right, the up arrow key to move up, and the down arrow key to move down.
